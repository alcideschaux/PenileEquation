## Material & Method
From a previously published dataset of 375 pateints with penile SCC () we selected 192 cases based on the availability of enough data in clinical charts and pathology reports, microscopic slides for examination, and follow-up information. The following data were included for each case: patient’s age (in years), clinical status of the inguinal lymph nodes, histological type of the primary tumor, histological grade, anatomical level of maximum tumor infiltration, and the presence of vascular, perineural, and urethral invasion. 

**Clinical Staging of Inguinal Lymph Nodes**
For clinical staging of inguinal lymph nodes (cN status) the latest TNM classification system was used and consisted of the following categories: cN0) no palpable inguinal nodes; cN1) palpable mobile unilateral inguinal lymph node; cN2) palpable mobile multiple or bilateral inguinal lymph nodes; and, cN3) unilateral or bilateral palpable fixed inguinal nodal mass or pelvic lymphadenopathy. Clinically positive inguinal nodes (cN+) included cN1, cN2, and cN3 stages.

**Histologic Subtype**
For histological subtyping of penile SCC morphological criteria outlined in the latest Atlas of Tumor Pathology of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) on the topic were used. Tumors were grouped in two categories, based on their inherent aggressiveness and propensity for inguinal nodal metastases: a) tumors with high propensity for nodal involvement: basaloid, sarcomatoid, pseudoglandular, and adenosquamous SCC subtypes; and, b) the remainder of SCC subtypes.

**Histologic Grade**
Histological grades were assigned according to previously reported and validated criteria, as it follows: grade 1) tumor entirely composed of neoplastic cells resembling normal squamous cells with minimal basal/parabasal nuclear atypia; grade 2) tumors not fitting criteria for grade 1 or grade 3; grade 3) tumors composed of any proportion of anaplastic cells showing nuclear pleomorphism, coarse chromatin, prominent nucleolus, irregular and thickened nuclear membrane, abundant and atypical mitoses. For statistical analyses histological grades were grouped in two categories: 1) well-differentiated (grade 1) tumors; and, b) moderately and poorly (grades 2 and 3) tumors.

**Tumor Anatomic Level of Invasion**
Tumors were classified in two groups according to their microscopically-confirmed level of deepest invasion: a) tumors limited to lamina propria or corpus spongiosum; and, b) tumors invading corpora cavernosa, including tunica albuginea.

**Vascular, perineural, and urethral invasion**
Vascular invasion was defined as the presence of tumor cells/emboli in well-defined vascular spaces, either lymphatic or venous. For perineural invasion the presence of tumor cells within any of the 3 layers of the nerve bundle (epineurium, perineurium, or endoneurium) was required. Urethral invasion was considered positive when tumor was identified within the urethral mucosa, either as an intraepithelial spread or infiltrating lamina propria.

**Final Inguinal Nodal Status**
The status of inguinal lymph nodes was established as follows: a) a lymph node was considered positive if pathologically proven metastasis was observed in the specimen (for those cases with lymphadenectomy); b) a lymph node was considered negative if no microscopic evidence of metastatic disease was observed in the lymphadenectomy specimen or if the patient did not present clinical evidence of metastatic nodal disease during the follow-up period.
